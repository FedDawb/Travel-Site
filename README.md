## Barcelona Travel Website
The Barcelona Travel Website was created as a passion project after I visited Barcelona and fell in love with the city. During my trip, I was captivated by the vibrant culture, stunning architecture, and incredible experiences I had. Inspired by my journey, I decided to build this site to share my personal recommendations and experiences with others.

The site includes the places I visited, such as iconic landmarks, hidden gems, and my favorite spots for dining and relaxation. Additionally, I've incorporated pictures I personally took during my trip, allowing visitors to explore the beauty of Barcelona through my lens. It’s my way of bringing a piece of this unforgettable city to others who may be planning to visit or simply want to experience it virtually.
