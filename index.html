            <h3>Culture and history</h3>
            <p>
              Located on the Mediterranean coast, Barcelona is one of the
              world’s most popular tourist destinations. This cosmopolitan city
              is also one of Spain’s most important economic, cultural, and
              commercial hubs, attracting both leisure and business tourism from
              all over the globe. Every year, thousands of tourists visit
              Barcelona to discover its uniqueness or attend numerous
              conferences, committees, and other types of meetings.
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from its museums and monuments, Barcelona is full of not
              only art but also has a more relaxed side shown in the form of
              sunny beaches that combine perfectly with delicious cuisine,
              details that make the city a real paradise for all kinds of
              visitors.

                <p>
                  Satan's serves one of the best cups of coffee you'll get in
                  Barcelona, and their blends of Right Side Coffee – among the
                  best in the city – are in constant rotation, so you can always
                  try something different. They also serve the makings for a
                  spectacular breakfast: 'Everything pairs well with coffee – I
                  recommend the traditional Japanese breakfast, with rice,
                  omelette, spinach, miso soup and coffee,' says Marcos
                  Bartolomé, the man behind the enterprise.

                <h4>Cafés El Magnífico</h4>
                <p>
                  At this coffee shop and roaster that first opened in 1989,
                  you'll find roasting as well as wholesale and retail sale of
                  single-origin coffees and exceptional blends – in all
                  speciality formats, cold infusion included, and shakerato as
                  well. There's also an area where you can have an excellent cup
                  of coffee. It's not cheap, but the high quality of the coffee
                  is worth the extra coins once in a while. The capuccinos are
                  especially delicious.

                <p>
                  You can't beat the combo of a really good coffee and a
                  delicious sandwich. That's just what the Ascasos (pioneers of
                  the express café in Spain) had in mind when they opened Black
                  Remedy. Much as I hate to use the term, this is a 'concept
                  store' of artisan fast food that connects Brooklyn with the
                  Barri Gòtic: the breads are from Cloudstreet Bakery, nothing
                  is processed, and when you get your mouth around the bomb of
                  amazingness that is their pastrami sandwich – aromatic,
                  grilled, with a touch of delicate mustard – you know that few
                  can match it. Their forte is anything smoked, and some items
                  are smoked up to 15 hours.
